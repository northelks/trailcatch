											<h3 id="infocollect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO I COLLECT?</h3>
											<p><b>Personal information you disclose to me</b></p>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I collect personal information that you provide to us.
											</p>
											<p>I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to me when
												you register on the App, express an interest in obtaining information
												about me or my products and App, when you participate in activities on
												the App, or otherwise when you contact me.</p>
											<p><b>Personal Information Provided by You</b>. The personal information
												that I collect depends on the context of your interactions with me and
												the App, the choices you make, and the products and features you use.
												The personal information I collect may include the following:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>names</li>
												<li>email addresses</li>
												<li>usernames</li>
												<li>contact preferences</li>
												<li>contact or authentication data</li>
											</ul>
											<p><b>Sensitive Information</b>. When necessary, with your consent or as
												otherwise permitted by applicable law, I process the following
												categories of sensitive information:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>health data</li>
												<li>geolocation data</li>
											</ul>
											<p><b>Social Media Login Data</b>. I may provide you with the option to
												register with the App using your existing social media account details,
												like your Facebook, X, or other social media account. If you choose to
												register in this way, I will collect certain profile information about
												you from the social media provider, as described in the section called
												"<a href="#sociallogins">HOW DO I HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</a>" below.
											</p>
											<p><b>Application Data</b>. If you use my application(s), I also may collect
												the following information if you choose to provide me with access or
												permission:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Geolocation Information. I may access location-based information
													from your synced activities or from uploaded *.fit files. If you
													wish to change my access, you may do not save trail/activity
													geolocations while publishing your trails in the App.</li>
												<li>Mobile Device Data. I automatically collect device information (such
													as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating
													system, version information and system configuration information,
													device and application identification numbers, browser type and
													version, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile
													carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If
													you are using my application(s), I may also collect information
													about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your
													mobile device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile
													device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and
													information about the features of my application(s) you accessed.
												</li>
												<li>Push Notifications. I may request to send you push notifications
													regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If
													you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications,
													you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
												operation of my application(s), for troubleshooting, and for my internal
												analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
											<p>All personal information that you provide to me must be true, complete,
												and accurate, and you must notify me of any changes to such personal
												information.</p>


											<h3 id="infouse">2. HOW DO I PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I process your information to provide, improve, and
												administer my App, communicate with you, for security and fraud
												prevention, and to comply with law. I may also process your information
												for other purposes with your consent.</p>
											<p>I process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending
												on how you interact with my App, including:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise
													manage user accounts. I may process your information so you can
													create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in
													working order.</li>
												<li>To deliver and facilitate delivery of App to the user. I may process
													your information to provide you with the requested service.</li>
												<li>To save or protect an individual's vital interest. I may process
													your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s
													vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I only process your personal information when I believe
												it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e. , legal basis) to
												do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws,
												to provide you with App to enter into or fulfill my contractual
												obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill my legitimate
												business interests.</p>
											<p><b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</b>
											</p>
											<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to
												explain the valid legal bases I rely on in order to process your
												personal information. As such, I may rely on the following legal bases
												to process your personal information:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Consent. I may process your information if you have given me
													permission (i.e. , consent) to use your personal information for a
													specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn
													more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.
												</li>
												<li>Performance of a Contract. I may process your personal information
													when I believe it is necessary to fulfill my contractual obligations
													to you, including providing my App or at your request prior to
													entering into a contract with you.</li>
												<li>Legal Obligations. I may process your information where I believe it
													is necessary for compliance with my legal obligations, such as to
													cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise
													or defend my legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence
													in litigation in which I are involved.</li>
												<li>Vital Interests. I may process your information where I believe it
													is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests
													of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
													the safety of any person.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In legal terms, I am generally the "data controller" under European data
												protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy
												notice, since I determine the means and/or purposes of the data
												processing I perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal
												information I process as a "data processor" on behalf of my customers.
												In those situations, the customer that I provide App to and with whom I
												have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller"
												responsible for your personal information, and I merely process your
												information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you
												want to know more about my customers' privacy practices, you should read
												their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>

											<p><b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b></p>
											<p>I may process your information if you have given me specific permission
												(i.e. , express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
												purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. ,
												implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your
													consent</a> at any time.</p>
											<p>In some exceptional cases, I may be legally permitted under applicable
												law to process your information without your consent, including, for
												example:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
													consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
												<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
												<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
												<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
													necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
												<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
													with next of kin</li>
												<li>If I have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
													or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
												<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
													compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
													the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
													breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
													province</li>
												<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
													order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
												</li>
												<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their
													employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent
													with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
												<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
													purposes</li>
												<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
													regulations</li>
											</ul>

											<h3 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL
												INFORMATION?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I may share information in specific situations described
												in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
											<p>I may need to share your personal information in the following
												situations:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Business Transfers</b>. I may share or transfer your information
													in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
													company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of my
													business to another company.</li>
											</ul>

											<h3 id="sociallogins">5. HOW DO I HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: If you choose to register or log in to my App using a
												social media account, I may have access to certain information about
												you.</p>
											<p>My App offer you the ability to register and log in using your
												third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
												logins). Where you choose to do this, I will receive certain profile
												information about you from your social media provider. The profile
												information I receive may vary depending on the social media provider
												concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
												list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
												make public on such a social media platform.</p>
											<p>I will use the information I receive only for the purposes that are
												described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
												on the relevant App. Please note that I do not control, and are not
												responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
												third-party social media provider. I recommend that you review their
												privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
												personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
												their sites and apps.</p>

											<h3>6. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I keep your information for as long as necessary to
												fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
												required by law.</p>
											<p>I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
												for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer
												retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
												accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
												require me keeping your personal information for longer than the period
												of time in which users have an account with me.</p>
											<p>When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
												information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
												this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
												been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your
												personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
												deletion is possible.</p>

											<h3>7. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: I aim to protect your personal information through a
												system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
											<p>I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
												organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
												personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and
												efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
												Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
												secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
												or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my
												security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
												information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal
												information, transmission of personal information to and from my App is
												at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure
												environment.</p>

											<h3>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in
												some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom
												(UK), Switzerland, and Canada , you have rights that allow you greater
												access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
												change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
												country, province, or state of residence.</p>
											<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada ), you have
												certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
												the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
												information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
												the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
												portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In
												certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
												processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
												contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "<a
													href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a>
												below.</p>
											<p>I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
												data protection laws.</p>
											<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe I am unlawfully
												processing your personal information, you also have the right to
												complain to your <a
													href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"
													target="_blank">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a
													href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/"
													target="_blank">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>
											<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a
													href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html"
													target="_blank">Federal Data Protection and Information
													Commissioner</a>.</p>
											<p id="withdrawconsent"><b>Withdrawing your consent</b>: If I am relying on
												your consent to process your personal information, which may be express
												and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
												right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
												consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact details
												provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT
													THIS NOTICE?</a>" below or updating your preferences .</p>
											<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
												processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
												it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
												reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
											<p><b>Account Information</b></p>
											<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your
												account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, I will deactivate or delete
												your account and information from my active databases. However, I may
												retain some information in my files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
												problems, assist with any investigations, enforce my legal terms and/or
												comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
											<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
												email me at <a
													href="mailto:trailcatch@icloud.com">trailcatch@icloud.com</a>.</p>


											<h3>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
											<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
												applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can
												activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
												online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
												uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
												has been finalized . As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser
												signals or mobile operating systems or mobile applications or any other
												mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
												online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow
												in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised
												version of this privacy notice.</p>
											<p>California law requires me to let you know how I respond to web browser
												DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
												standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, I do not respond to
												them at this time.</p>

											<h3>10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
											<p><b>In Short</b>: If you are a resident of California, Colorado,
												Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New
												Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia , you
												may have the right to request access to and receive details about the
												personal information I maintain about you and how I have processed it,
												correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal
												information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to my
												processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in
												some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided
												below.</p>
											<p>Categories of Personal Information I Collect</p>
											<p>I have collected the following categories of personal information in the
												past twelve (12) months:</p>

											<p><b>Your Rights</b></p>
											<p>You have rights under certain US state data protection laws. However,
												these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, I may decline your
												request as permitted by law. These rights include:</p>

											<ul>
												<li><b>Right to know</b> whether or not I are processing your personal
													data</li>
												<li><b>Right to access</b> your personal data</li>

												<li><b>Right to opt out</b> of the processing of your personal data if
													it is used for targeted advertising (or sharing as defined under
													California’s privacy law) , the sale of personal data, or profiling
													in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly
													significant effects ( "profiling" )</li>
											</ul>

											<p>Depending upon the state where you live, you may also have the following
												rights:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Right to obtain</b> a list of the categories of third parties to
													which I have disclosed personal data (as permitted by applicable
													law, including California's and Delaware's privacy law)</li>
												<li><b>Right to obtain</b> a list of specific third parties to which I

												from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
												validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable
												laws.</p>

											<p><b>Request Verification</b></p>
											<p>Upon receiving your request, I will need to verify your identity to
												determine you are the same person about whom I have the information in

												me, I may request that you provide additional information for the
												purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
												purposes.</p>
											<p>If you submit the request through an authorized agent, I may need to
												collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
												your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
												permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>

											<p><b>Appeals</b></p>
