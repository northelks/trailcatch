									<p>
										To create a new account, click the "Join TrailCatch" button. Follow the steps on
										the next screen to set up your account.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you already have an account, use the "Join TrailCatch" button as well. The
										app remembers your last login, making it easy to recognize the account you
										previously used.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> effortlessly with your favorite social
										account.

									<h4 id="1.2" class="comm">1.2. At what age is it allowed to use the TrailCatch app?
										<a href="#1.2">#</a>
									</h4>

									<p>
										The <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app is allowed to be used by users aged
										16 and older.
									</p>

									<p>
										This rule is stated in the <a href="/terms" target="_blank">TERMS AND
											CONDITIONS</a>.
									</p>
									<br />

									<h4 id="1.3" class="comm">1.3. How to complete my account creation? <a
											href="#1.3">#</a></h4>

									<p>
										You need to fill in your account details by specifying your gender and age
										group. Nationality is optional. Here, you can also add information about your
										dogs.
									</p>
									<p>
										After that, you will be directed to the Face ID & Passcode screen, where you can
										set up secure protection for your account. Next, you will reach the push
										notification settings screen, and then you should read the information about ATT
										(App Tracking Transparency) and decide whether to allow it or not.

									<h4 id="1.4" class="comm">1.4. Why do I only see the year and month, but not the
										days, when filling out my age group? <a href="#1.4">#</a></h4>

									<p>
										The <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app intentionally does not ask for your
										full birth date. This is done to avoid storing detailed personal data, such as
										your exact birth date. This helps keep your data more secure.
									</p>
									<p>
										To determine your age group, the <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app only
										uses the year and month of your birth. This is sufficient.
									</p>
									<p>
										<img src="images/faq/1/age_1.jpg" class="img-faq" />

									<br />

									<h4 id="1.5" class="comm">1.5. How to try the app demo? <a href="#1.5">#</a></h4>

									<p>
										To explore the app without creating an account, select the "Try Demo" option.
										This allows you to log in with a demo account and check out the app's features.
										Note that some functionalities are unavailable in demo account - you'll see a
										notification if this applies.

									<h4 id="1.6" class="comm">1.6. How to log out of the app? <a href="#1.6">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										To log out of the app, go to the settings menu and select the "Log Out" option.
										This will disconnect your account from the app while keeping your data safe. You
										can log back in at any time using the same account.

									<h4 id="1.7" class="comm">1.7. Why I need to use Face ID & Passcode? <a
											href="#1.7">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										To protect your account, it’s best to use iOS security features like Face ID or
										Passcode (PIN code).
									</p>

									<p>
										It’s important to note that this type of protection ensures that no one can
										delete your account without your permission. Only after successfully passing
										Face ID or Passcode verification can your account be deleted.

									<h4 id="2.1" class="comm">2.1. Profile & Dogs <a href="#2.1">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										In the <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app, you can complete your profile by
										adding your username, name, gender, age group, and nationality. Additionally,
										you can include your social media links: Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly
										Twitter), Strava, YouTube, or your email address.
									</p>
									<p>
										And you can add your dog to your profile - whether you go for walks, runs, or
										bike trails together. Plus, you can include as many dogs as you have!
									</p>
									<p>
										For your beloved dogs, you can specify their name, gender, and age. Even more
										importantly, you can indicate their breed. Take advantage of the extensive
										catalog of dog breeds to find the perfect match for your furry friend!
									</p>
									<p>
										The dog breed catalog is based on open and free information provided by
										Wikipedia. To learn more about a specific breed, you can either tap on the "Open
										Wikipedia" button or, if you're in list view, tap on a breed and select "Open
										Wikipedia."
									</p>
									<p>
										If you can’t find your dog’s breed in the catalog, don’t worry! You can always
										manually enter the breed name in the "Custom Breed Name" field.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the years pass and life takes its course, there come moments when we must say
										goodbye to our beloved furry friends. To cherish their memory, you can use the
										"Always in our Hearts" option. This way, you won’t need to remove your dog from
										the app. While they won’t appear in the selection for next new trails, you’ll
										always be able to see them in your profile. ❤️

									<h4 id="2.2" class="comm">2.2. Statistics <a href="#2.2">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										In the <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app, the Statistics screen lets you
										track your history of walks, runs, or bike trails. The graph also includes
										statistics for activities with your dogs. If your activity involved a dog, it
										will be marked as such on the graph.
									</p>
									<p>
										Trails & Distance displays the number of trails completed during the year or
										month, along with the total distance covered and time spent.
									</p>
									<p>
										The main graph provides an overview of all your activities over the years -
										current and past. Scrolling down, you’ll find a monthly breakdown of your
										trails, including the average pace for walks and runs or the average speed for
										bike trails.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the Profile page, just below, you'll find a grid with yellow markers - a nice
										representation of your monthly activity. You can tap on the grid to view a
										detailed list of all the trails completed during that month.
									</p>
									<p>
										And of course, there are your subscribers - where would we be without them! On
										your profile page, you'll also find the Subscribers section. By tapping on it,
										you can see a list of your subscribers and the people you’re following
										(subscriptions).
									</p>
									<p>
										And let’s not forget about the likes! Likes shows the total number of likes
										across all your trails. If you tap on Likes, you’ll see your trails sorted by
										the ones with the most likes.
									</p>

									<h4 id="2.3" class="comm">2.3. Radar <a href="#2.3">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										Each trail has either one or three geolocation points, used to calculate the
										distance between the trail and its nearest city.
									</p>
									<p>
										Double-tap on the Radar to discover more cities and their distances.
									</p>
									<p>
										All trails you see on Radar are sorted based on your selected city, with the
										closest trails to the city center shown first.
									</p>
									<p>
										The idea is that you’ll see cities closest to the center point of your selected
										city, and Radar will display the distances of trails belonging to the nearest
										city for each.
									</p>
									<p>
										When a trail has one or three geolocation points, the first (or single) point is
										always at least 200 meters from the trail's start, the second marks the
										midpoint, and the third is always at least 200 meters before the trail's end.

									<h4 id="2.4" class="comm">2.4. GeoLocation <a href="#2.4">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										When publishing your trail, you can choose how many geolocation points you want
										to save - either three or just one. These points are used to determine the
										distance to nearby cities. If you choose all three, they will be used to find
										the shortest distance. If you select one point, only that one will be used for
										the search.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can also delete all geolocation points from your trail. In this case, your
										trail will no longer appear in search results, but it will always be visible in
										your profile.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> does not store the geolocation of your trails
										in plain, open form. All geolocation data is saved on the server in encrypted
										form. Even if it is stolen, no one will be able to read it.
									</p>

										For more details on how your data is protected, refer to section <a
											href="#account-and-security">"3. Account and Security"</a>

									<h4 id="2.5" class="comm">2.5. Trails <a href="#2.5">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										In the <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app, on the main page, you can see a
										feed of trails from people you’re subscribed to. As soon as your friends publish
										a new trails, you’ll instantly see them here.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the Filtered tab, you can view trails through the lens of various filters.
										The filter has a wide range of functions, and you can learn more about it in
										section <a href="#2.8">"2.8. Search Filters."</a>
									</p>
									<p>
										On the Trails page, you’ll find a list of all your trails. To access this
										screen, tap on Trails from your profile page, or select the corresponding
										section in the app menu. The menu can be accessed by tapping the icon at the top
										right of the profile page.
									</p>

									<p>
										Here you can filter your trails by the devices you've connected with. You can
										also choose to show only trails involving walks, runs, or bike trails. And of
										course, you can display only the trails with your beloved dogs.
									</p>

									<p>
										When you move a trail to the trash, you can always find your trashed trails on
										the Trails page by tapping the icon at the top. Any trail can be completely and
										permanently deleted - just tap the icon at the top to view all trails in the
										trash. Then, tap on the trail icon and delete it. Once a trail is deleted, it
										cannot be restored unless you upload and publish it again.

									<h4 id="2.6" class="comm">2.6. Trail Graph <a href="#2.6">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										Each trail has metadata gathered from the devices it has synced with or from a
										FIT file.
									</p>
									<p>
										Trails include the following charts: Pace (only for walks and runs), Speed,
										Power, Heart Rate, Cadence/Bike Cadence, Respiration Rate, Elevation, Training
										Effect, and Calories.
									</p>
									<p>
										When publishing your trail, you can choose to show or hide specific charts. If
										"Always On" is displayed under a chart, that chart cannot be hidden and will
										always be shown.
									</p>
									<p>
										Each chart displays only 10 data points, excluding the starting zero (0) point.
										As a rule, <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> shows the first kilometer (or
										mile, depending on your app settings) as the second point, and the last point is
										the very last point of the trail. All other points between the first and last
										are displayed randomly. You can tap on the chart to see it change slightly,
										displaying different trail points. This allows you to find the specific points
										on your trail and learn more about any given parameter (such as heart rate or
										power values).
									</p>
									<p>
										At the top of the chart/graph, you’ll see the value for the parameter. At the
										bottom, you'll first see the distance point, followed by the time for that point
										and the distance of trail.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											38'42 means 38 minutes and 42 seconds.
										</li>
										<li>
											1:44'23 means 1 hour, 44 minutes, and 23 seconds.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										If you see "km | miles" in the top-left corner of the chart, you have the option
										to switch to the original distance measurement scale for the selected trail.
										People from different countries use different units for distance, either
										kilometers or miles. Therefore, if one user creates a trail using kilometers,
										another user who has set their app to display miles will be able to switch to
										the trail’s display in miles.
									</p>
									<p>
										The conversion/calculation of distance from kilometers to miles, and vice versa,
										involves some rounding. Rounding is also applied when calculating average
										values, so do not treat the trail data as absolutely precise.
									</p>

									<p>
										Here’s a brief description of each term:
									<ul>

										options.
									</p>
									<p>
										The filter applies to the trails of people you are subscribed to. It can also be
										used on the Radar page, where you search for trails near a selected city.
									</p>
									<p>
										With the filter, you can choose:
									<ul>
										<li>Trail type - Walk, Run, or Bike (with or without Dogs)</li>
										<li>Nearby - all trails or only those from people you are not subscribed to
											("Strangers Only")</li>
										<li>Genders - Male, Female or Non-binary</li>
										<li>Age groups - from 16 to 80+</li>
										<li>Nationalities</li>
										<li>Dog Breeds</li>
									</ul>
									</p>

									<h4 id="2.9" class="comm">2.9. Nearby Your City <a href="#2.9">#</a></h4>
									<p>
										Each trail can have one or three geolocation points. Using these points, <span
											class="pp">TrailCatch</span> determines the distance from the trail to
										nearby cities.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the graph, you can see a Radar chart that shows 8 cities. The cities are
										arranged based on their geographical location relative to the selected trail.
									</p>
									<p>
										Here are the 8 cardinal directions and their abbreviations:
									<ul>
										<li>North (N)</li>
										<li>North-East (NE)</li>
										<li>East (E)</li>
										<li>South-East (SE)</li>
										<li>South (S)</li>
										<li>South-West (SW)</li>
										<li>West (W)</li>
										<li>North-West (NW)</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, "N ~ 37 km" means that the city to the north is 37 kilometers away
										from the current trail.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can double-tap on the Radar, and it will refresh, showing new cities with
										different distances. This way, <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> uses an
										interesting concept where you can tap on the radar to explore and view which
										cities are near the trail, depending on their distance in different geographical
										directions.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you tap once on the Radar, options will appear that allow you to jump
										directly to a city you're interested in, to see its location on the map.
									</p>
									<p>
										Here, you can also repeat the same function as with the double tap on the Radar,
										by selecting "Catch Next Map ~ 75 km". This means that the next update on the
										Radar chart will show cities within a 75-kilometer radius from the trail. If you
										come back to this option later, you’ll see "Catch Next Map ~ 100 km".
									</p>
									<p>
										In this way, you can search not only for cities close to the trail but also for
										more distant ones. The available search radius options are: 25 km, 50 km, 75 km,
										100 km, 125 km, 150 km, 175 km, and 200 km.
									</p>
									<p>
										And as mentioned in previous sections, <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> knows
										about miles! So, if you’ve set your app to use miles for trail distances, the
										Radar chart will be generated in miles. In that case, it will display "Catch
										Next Map ~ 75 miles", with available radius search options: 25 mi, 50 mi, 75 mi,
										100 mi, 125 mi, 150 mi, 175 mi, and 200 mi.
									</p>
									<p>
										And it's important to mention again the following: when a trail has one or three
										geolocation points, the first (or single) point is
										always at least 200 meters from the trail's start, the second marks the
										midpoint, and the third is always at least 200 meters before the trail's end.
										This is the first level of protection for your geographical location.
									</p>

									<p>
										The second level of protection is the method of storing the geolocation points
										of the trail - they are stored on the server only in an encrypted form.
										You can read more about this here <a href="#account-and-security">"3. Account
											and Security"</a>.

										<span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> allows you to create and publish your trails
										using popular devices such as Garmin, Suunto, and Polar. You can also take

									</p>
									<p>
										Every time you connect a device, the app attempts to synchronize all trails. (In
										the future, you will be able to select specific time periods for
										synchronization).
									</p>
									<p>
										Each time the app is launched, trails are synchronized based on the connected
										devices. Here, the search for new trails and their synchronization only occurs
										for the past 24 hours. To add more new trails, go to the Devices screen, select
										the device you need, and specify the time period you want to synchronize.

									<p></p>

									<p>As a solo developer on the project, I was looking for optimal ways to implement
										backend
										functionality. I wanted to store all the data in structured formats, so I really
										wanted to use
										PostgreSQL. With my solid knowledge of Linux, I considered using a DigitalOcean
										service to set
										up a small Linux server with a PostgreSQL database. But then, I thought about
										the process of
										setting up the server, configuring the database... and optimizing all the
										processes. Plus, I
										imagined that things would inevitably crash periodically. Then there are backups
										and other
										administrative tasks. Knowing from experience how much time this would take and
										how complicated
										it would be for a single person, I decided to dismiss the idea of using a VPS or
										dedicated
										server.</p>
									<p>So, cloud computing was the next option. The big players offer mind-blowing
										possibilities to do
										this and that, and then another thing, and then through this. The only thing
										left is to find a
										major investor who would be willing to invest $1M into the project to cover all
										the expenses...
										Well, okay, that’s a joke, of course. But for someone developing a project alone
										without
										funding, the big cloud providers are simply out of reach.</p>
									<p>And then I remembered this amazing backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform called <a
											href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a> (not an ad).</p>
									<p>With Supabase, I was able to solve my backend dilemma - SQL queries + RPC from
										mobile side. And
										yes, without a single line of backend code.</p>

									<p>The database structure looks like this:</p>
									<p>
										<img src="images/faq/11/db_arch.png" class="img-db" />
									</p>

									<p>The entire functionality of the database operates through just 7 small tables.
									</p>
									<p>I don’t store user passwords in the database. All logins are done through users'
										social media accounts. I also don’t use an email + password combination. When
										there’s nothing sensitive to store, there’s nothing sensitive that can be
										stolen.</p>
									<p>Here, I want to show how user personal data looks when synchronized with their
										devices during trail creation. This includes how geolocation points are stored.
									</p>
									<p>These data aren’t stored in plaintext. Before adding this data to the database, I
										encrypt it using the PostgreSQL function <span
											class="pp">pgp_sym_encrypt</span>. The encryption happens on the <a
											href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/vault"
											target="_blank">Supabase Vault</a> platform with their keys, which are
										stored separately from the backend. This means that even if all the database
										data is stolen, sensitive user data, such as heart rates and geolocations, will
										remain encrypted.</p>

									<p>
										<img src="images/faq/11/db_encr.png" class="img-db" style="height: 300px;" />
									</p>

									<p>Here’s how user's contacts look in the database.
									</p>

									<p>
										<img src="images/faq/11/db_contacts.png" class="img-db"
											style="height: 100px;" />
									</p>

									<p>After defining the overall database structure, the next step is to describe the
										SQL functions that handle all backend operations.</p>
									<p>It’s worth mentioning that I don’t use a dedicated backend language (like
										JavaScript + Node, Python, Java, or Rust… Rust, hmm, that would have been a good
										choice).
										To simplify the task and avoid maintaining the backend part, I decided to build
										everything on PostgreSQL functions, which are called from the mobile app via RPC
										(remote procedure call).</p>
									<p>
										Here’s an example of one such function. In this case, I’m searching for the
										nearest trails to a city's geographic coordinates.

									<p>Next is the mobile side of the <span class="pp">TrailCatch</span> app.</p>
									<p>
										When it comes to say the technology I chose for building the mobile app, it’s
										quite straightforward - <a href="https://flutter.dev"
											target="_blank">Flutter</a>. It’s an excellent framework for mobile app
										development from <span class="pp">Google</span>. I’ve been working with it for
										years now, and I’m very satisfied with the experience.

									<p>
										For those familiar with the stack, here’s the combination I use:<br />
										Flutter + Provider + GetIt + FL Chart + Supabase + Qonversion + Geosort +
										Geodesy + Sentry + Firebase Messaging + Encrypted Shared Preferences.
